# Jarvis Backend

This repository hosts the backend for the Jarvis Smart Home project. It is built using Django and Python, leverages LangChain for advanced AI functionality, and uses Daphne as its ASGI server for real-time WebSocket communication. The backend handles AI interactions, processes natural language commands, and interfaces with the hardware integration module to deliver a seamless smart home experience.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Manage real-time communication, process natural language commands, and control hardware devices for smart home automation.

- **Features:**  
  - Real-time WebSocket communication via Daphne.
  - AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) using Django, Python, and LangChain.
  - REST APIs for device control and data exchange with the hardware integration module.
  - Scalable architecture for integrating additional smart home functionalities.

- **Technologies:**  
  - **Django** – Web framework for building robust backend services.
  - **Python** – Primary programming language.
  - **LangChain** – For advanced AI and NLP capabilities.
  - **Daphne** – ASGI server for handling real-time communications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`
